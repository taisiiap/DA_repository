# Studying the patterns that determine the success of games

## Task:
Using historical data on sales of computer games, user and expert ratings, genres and platforms, identify patterns that determine the success of a game

## Description:
The parameters that determine the success of the game in different regions of the world are revealed. Based on this, a report was prepared for a computer games store to plan advertising campaigns. Data preprocessing and analysis were carried out. The current period for analysis has been selected. Compiled portraits of users in each region. Hypotheses tested: the average user ratings of the Xbox One and PC platforms are the same; the average user ratings for the Action and Sports genres are different. The analysis used Student's t-test for independent samples.

## Results:
The computer games market was experiencing a powerful upswing with the development of new technologies for both the manufacture of games and the manufacture of consoles. 

Games released on different consoles bring different revenue, have different critics' ratings.Critics' ratings have very little effect on the revenue of games, as well as user ratings.

The online store should pay attention to games in the genre of Action and Shooter - they are liked by users all over the world. If sales are directed to Japan, games in the role-play genre will also be a success. In America and Europe, people are more likely to buy games on PS4, but it's better for Japanese residents to advertise Nintendo 3DS
