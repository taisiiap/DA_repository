# Research of the public catering market in Moscow to make a decision about opening of a new one

## Task:
Market research in Moscow to make a decision about opening of a new establishment

## Description:
I have investigated the question - will a cafe be successful and popular for a long time, in which guests are served by robotic waiters. Based on the results of the analysis, a presentation was prepared for investors with recommendations. In plotting, I used the seaborn and plotly libraries.

## Results:
40% of all catering facility are cafes, followed by canteens and restaurants. A very small number of catering facility in the departments of culinary and snack bars. 
Every fifth institution in Moscow is a network one. Fast food prevails among the chains. The average number of seats among all establishments in Moscow is 40. There are much more seats in canteens and restaurants, but there are fewer such establishments than popular cafes and fast food outlets.

For a place where robots can serve food, you need to find the perfect combination of price and quality with the optimal number of seats. A cafe or restaurant is suitable for this task. Since robots are expensive, it may be worth stopping at a cafe as a less expensive option. On the other hand, an exclusive restaurant can attract a more affluent audience and pay off just as quickly. A chain institution has an advantage - other points can help in promoting and maintaining the image.

Since the service personnel will be robots, this will require large financial investments, as well as the rent in the center is much higher than in remote areas. Therefore, at the first stage it would be reasonable to open a cafe with a small number of seats, for example 10-20. Thus, the costs of both rent and the robots themselves will be reduced.

It is better to choose an area in the center where there are tourists and walkers, plus fewer competitors. Pay attention to the Basmanny and Tagansky districts.
