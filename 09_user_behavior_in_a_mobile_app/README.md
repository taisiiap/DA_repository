# Analysis of user behavior in a mobile app

## Task:
Analyze the sales funnel and evaluate the results of A/A/B testing based on data from the use of a mobile application for selling food products

## Description:
In this project, I studied the principles of event analytics. I built a sales funnel, explored the path of users to purchase. Analyzed the results of an A/B test for introducing new fonts. Compared 2 control groups with each other, made sure that the traffic was properly divided, and then compared with the test group. It was revealed that the new font will not significantly affect user behavior.
